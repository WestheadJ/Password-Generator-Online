# Password-Generator-Online-API

This password generator is free to use and copy under the specified license. 

This is a password generator that stores important information on device!
How it works: 
You get a salt and key, make note of these somewhere but make sure they aren't seen by anyone. These are used in the password generation if they are found out check out this section.

First insert a phrase in the phrase box for example the application you will use like snapchat. And store this phrase in your password manager with the key and salt or in safe place.

Then secondly click generate and you get your password, if it doesn't show up straight away give it a minute or 2 and the server will start up or your network speeds are slow. Then you can click copy to clipboard for copying and pasting.

Advanced Settings:
There are advanced settings for change things with the generator.

1. For example if you are going to use a different device it will load a new Salt & Key so you can either input a Salt & Key from another device.

2. Delete your current Salt & Key and generate new ones, or you can delete just the Key or Salt.

3. Generate a new Key or generate a new Salt on it's own
